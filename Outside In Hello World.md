# Outside In

Outside in development is similar to waterfall, i  that you start from the highest level description of your project and a test for that description, and progressively refine both tests and code in parallel till you are done.

# Tooling
React
Vue

Testing libraries
Jest
Mocha

End to end testing 
Cypress 
Playwright

The killer feature of Playwright is: You can automatically generate tests by opening a web browser and manually running through the steps you want.



# Testing concepts

## Assertions and exceptions 

assert - something that should be the case
```
assert.equal(sum, 7);
```
Checks that the return value of sum is 7

Jest uses expect instead of assert, whic allows you to chain functions together.
```
expect(sum).toEqual(7);
```
Checks that use an expect are called expectations.

Cypress lets us check if an element on the page .contains() a specific string. 
   Questions 
      Is there any scoping for the contains?
      Is it negatable?
      at what point in the page render process is this checked?

## Cypress Docker


[Cypress Docker Github](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/docker)

There are Docker images:

cypress/base:<Node version> has the operating system dependencies required to run Cypress.
cypress/browsers:<tag> extends the base images with pre-installed browsers.
cypress/included:<Cypress version> extends the base images with pre-installed Cypress versions.

fluent-style API

When a Cypress test fails, it screenshots your app at the point of failure and saves the image to disk. Itâ€™s easy to configure your CI platform to keep these images as test artifacts for easy debugging.

Playwright produces a more complicated set of test artifacts. Instead of simple images and videos, Playwright generates a static web app for viewing all the test artifacts.



## Best Practices

"Stop requiring only one assertion per unit test: Multiple assertions are fine" "One test case, not one test assertion."
